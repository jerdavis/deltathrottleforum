				<div class="content">First off, I think this is fantastic...<br /><br />and totally unfair to people with MKB  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><br />I am wondering if the kickstarter is still being planned or if it turned out to be too time or money consuming ?<br /><br />I find it revolutionary... a trick concept but arrives at the most natural way to control multiple axis of thrust.<br /><br />it would really be able to completely replace rudders / joystick twist in a space sim, since there are only maneouvering thrusters, no?  Or does the mechanic not allow for tilting the green &quot;handle&quot; left or right, i.e. firing left mthrusters up and right mthrusters down?<br /><br />Ah well, most of what I say has probably been discussed 370 times here. But I wanted to say hi  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">Hi and welcome to the forums.<br />This and that have been talked about on here, yes. But not from all possible angles and points of view. So ventilate any and all opinions and ideas you might have.<br />My advise to you as a new arrival is to go through the various build threads here on the forum and see for yourself that every build so far is unique in some way.</div>

				<div class="content">Welcome to the forums!<br /><br />Current design is three axis translation, so it does not replace rudders or stick twist.<br /><br />There are possible delta geometries that allows for rotation as well, but I'm not sure if they would be feasible for a controller:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGyiXFGvkqE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGyiXFGvkqE</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br />Alternatively you could mount a handle to the handle base with one or more rotational axes, but again I'm unsure if it would be useful or there would be too much axis crosstalk.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcojMzFBodw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcojMzFBodw</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I myself am going to keep my rudders, since I don't have anything better to do with my feet and to avoid crosstalk as much as possible.</div>
