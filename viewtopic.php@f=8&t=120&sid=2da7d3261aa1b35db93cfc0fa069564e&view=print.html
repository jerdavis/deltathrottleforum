				<div class="content">That looks great!!!<br /><br />Is the tubing 2 inches long?<br /><br />Can you post the info.  -  stl file on the Pivot Arm?<br /><br />I'm looking into building one as well.<br /><br />Again great job!!!<br /><br />Thanks!!</div>

				<div class="content">Give me some time to fine tune the details and I will upload all .stl files needed for this mod.<br />Still haven't figured out the best way to secure 3D printed pivot arm on tubing, which btw is 2&quot; long <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I've placed an order yesterday for new springs and one today for some Actobotic parts from UK reseller.<br /><br />Updated parts list, stl files and instructions will follow after testing. Btw plan is to use magnetic sensors for this build.</div>

				<div class="content">Wow that looks great!!!<br /><br />I've been looking into Hall Effect sensors and researching into building one.  <br /><br />In the past I got magnets from <a href="https://www.amazingmagnets.com/" class="postlink">https://www.amazingmagnets.com/</a>  They offer different shapes and thought about using the ball version to fit the end of the 2 inch tubing would work and give a clean connection. <a href="https://www.amazingmagnets.com/show-decimal-s375c.aspx" class="postlink">https://www.amazingmagnets.com/show-decimal-s375c.aspx</a><br /><br />In researching I came across this: <a href="http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/6127V1A360L.5FS/987-1393-ND/2620662" class="postlink">http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/6127V1A360L.5FS/987-1393-ND/2620662</a> for $15 each US.  for that price... well it would save a lot of time building them from scratch... and they would be consistent verse an uncertain outcome that each custom built hall Effect Sensor could deviate from the other depending on the magnet placement.. etc. would give different readings.<br /><br />What do you think?  Are these good for what we need?<br /><br />Here is the spec sheet on them: <a href="http://www.bitechnologies.com/pdfs/6120.pdf" class="postlink">http://www.bitechnologies.com/pdfs/6120.pdf</a></div>

They show up in some models of commercial joysticks, as well as in after-market conversion kits for high end gaming hardware, such as the CubPilot Hall upgrade for the Thrustmaster HOTAS Cougar&quot;<br /><br />From my own experience, the less moving parts the longer the equipment will last.  <br /><br />To add these Hall Effect Sensors are much more quieter than normal potentiometers and have a ultra long-life, precision control solutions in harsh environments - grime, moisture, extreme temperature, or vibration (dither).  Their Rotational Life have 10 million shaft revolutions with up to 8 oz sideload and are Mil spec.  They are used in some models of commercial joysticks, as well as in after-market conversion kits for high end gaming hardware, such as the CubPilot Hall upgrade for the Thrustmaster HOTAS Cougar.<br /><br />Personally, if I'm making a throttle, I'm going to want top quality parts....  if I can get Mil spec parts... I know they will last.  <br /><br />The Delta Throttle is a brilliant idea... we all have different experiences and expertise, so we are just helping taking it to the next level any way any of us can... <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /></div>
