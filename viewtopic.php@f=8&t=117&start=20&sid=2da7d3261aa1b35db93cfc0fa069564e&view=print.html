				<div class="content">I also eagerly await zdayton's magnetic sensor design. In the mean time, here's a couple of ideas:<br />One based around the A1302 ratiometric angle sensor, a skate bearing, and a bic pen. <a href="http://simhq.com/forum/ubbthreads.php/topics/3225983/Re:_DIY_hall_sensor_...#Post3225983" class="postlink">http://simhq.com/forum/ubbthreads.php/topics/3225983/Re:_DIY_hall_sensor_...#Post3225983</a><br />The MMJOY thread on SimHQ is a 30+page nightmare. <a href="http://simhq.com/forum/ubbthreads.php/topics/3899105/1" class="postlink">http://simhq.com/forum/ubbthreads.php/topics/3899105/1</a> In the upper left, click the gray button &quot;Topic Options&quot; and &quot;print topic&quot; to get an unpaginated view.

				<div class="content">Still going to update one more part but here is what my design looks like so far:<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">Base</span><br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/kR9oGA1.jpg?1" alt="Image" /><br /><br />-Added lower base to hide electronics. <br />SC-Maik, I laughed when I saw your design as i had recently finished mine and the similarity was close!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> In my design, the head of the USB cable is fully within the base<br /> The upper base screws into the lower base. The lower base has the option to attach to the desk.<br /><br />-A hole in the middle of the upper base for wires to go through.<br /><br />-Redesign of Uprights to accommodate ball bearings. These will change as I am redesigning for cheaper Skateboard bearings.<br /><br />-Redesign of spring retention to remove need for screws. (SC-Maik has furthered this design with the ability to accommodate many spring diameters)<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">Arms</span><br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/EA2JrXU.jpg?2" alt="Image" /><br /><br />-The spring is moved to the other side of the arm. This allows a more compact design overall.<br /><br />-The angle of the spring to the arm is changed. <br /> The original design, when built, required the user to press the handle down while plugging in to get a decent center on the Z axis.<br /> This change in angle sets the handle in the middle of the Z axis with the springs at rest.<br /><br />-On the spring side, adjusted shaft diameter to fit in bearing (again, will be adjusted for new bearings)<br /><br />-On the Pot side, the shaft of the pot is still used but a bearing slides over the shaft. The forces of use are transferred to the bearing via the Pot shaft.<br /> Instead of a shaft sticking out of the arm, the Pot shaft extends into the arm itself as seen below:<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/lGTsFzD.jpg?1" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">To Do:</span><br /><br />-Redesign for Skateboard bearings (much cheaper)<br /><br />-One thing I am wanting to do but haven't figured out how: The spring angle is not always exact (manufacturing tolerances and whatnot)<br />I am trying to think of a way to minutely adjust the springs angle relative to the base as a way to calibrate the Delta Throttle to your specific springs.<br />In example, my current build shown in this post has a center that gives me slight forward thrust when I am not touching the throttle.</div>

				<div class="content">Great work, Sotnax!  Do you choose two-piece bearing pedestal/pillow block because it's problematic to print a horizontal bore that large?<br />I have a suggestion for your skate bearing redesign. The ID of the skate bearing is 8mm, while the shaft of most potentiometers is 1/4&quot; or 6.35mm. Could the arm extend through both bearings, while still having a bore to accept the pot shaft/magnetic angle sensor mount?</div>

				<div class="content">@ SC-Maik<br />I chose a 2-piece bearing pedestal for assembly reasons. <br />The way the spring attaches to the base, it needs to slide in from the side which would not be possible with the bearing pedestal as one piece.<br />Just got the skateboard bearings in. Initial thought was to print a sleeve that would slide between the Pot shaft and bearing.<br />It could also be attached to the arm as you suggest.<br />My concern now is that the thickness of this sleeve might be too small to print. I'll have to see how it turns out.<br /><br />Regarding spring adjustments:<br />I had an idea that isn't very ideal, but gets the job done.<br /><br /><img src="http://i115.photobucket.com/albums/n309/NismoN15/Render6_zpsemtovxjb.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Going off  SC-Maik's design above, If a second screw is added from under the base (which sits on a lower plate to hide electronics anyway (are you doing this with your aluminum build?))<br />To adjust, tweak both screws up or down to pinch the spring in place.<br /><br />VERY rough &quot;photoshop&quot; of your image to give example:<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/AMrDpSM.png?1" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Pros: It gets the job done<br />Cons: Adjusting will be annoying as you will have to lift the base with every tweak. (But theoretically only once right?)<br /><br />I am busy with school lately so I may have to step away from this project until I graduate in May. At the very lease I will continue to monitor/comment on the forums until I can re-engage.</div>

				<div class="content">I gave a lot of thinking regarding spring adjustment. A similar idea like yours crossed my mind, but I couldn't find a not bulky way to secure screws from loosing due to vibrations etc.<br />Also every micro adjustment meant that you have to lift the base (which I will keep on my aluminum built).<br /><br />On a final note I don't believe it is even worth doing it. What you wanted to accomplish at the first place (forward thrust on rest position) can be done with software. <br /><br />And most importantly, real life first. May is not far away, I will have time to fine tune details, test new stuff and I will wait for your comments <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>
