				<div class="content">Looks like just the two. It's actually easier to think of it as a multi-directional single switch.

				<div class="content">That would be very cool, if I had the technical know-how to implement it. I had been playing with the idea of trying to install another analog input on the new handle somwhere (like a slide potentiometer for cruising throttle or what have you) but the application of yet another mini-joystick on the handle face could be REALLY fun.<br /><br />Imagine ship power level management on the fly with just a thumb!<br /><br />However, I'm no CAD designer, and certainly no Arduino coder. I'd worry about trying to fit that in there somewhere, especially considering that I'm not seeing the size of the sensor listed in there.<br /><br />Still, great idea! Weren't you the guy working on getting Hall effect sensors to replace the main potentiometers?</div>

				<div class="content">No, that would be SC-maik (who has been inactive here on the forum from before I even arrived), I just use his ideas and discoveries in my own build.<br />I follow this thread closely because my Delta Throttle still hasn't got a handle yet. Designing things with ergonomics in mind isn't my strong point. I'm by no means an CAD expert, but I do use CAD software both at work and at home in my spare time.<br />Were you planning to redesign a handle to fit the switches rather than fitting the switches in an existing handle? Either way has its advantages and disadvantages I guess.<br /><br />I'll try to take a look at that magnetic thumb joystick module from AMS when I have some spare time. I hope it's not too complicated to use. It sure is tiny, so it would be very easy to mount. In fact it's so tiny that it would be theoretically possible to have one for each finger if my brain could muster enough simultaneous capacity to handle 4+1 button press actions per finger.</div>

				<div class="content">I just got the notification that my new handle has been printed and is ready to be picked up. I took the suggestion to get it printed 20% larger and used Zispinhoff's suggestion for a new pcb since the originals I had made at oshpark will now be too small. Currently, i only have two buttons and a hat connected to my original teardrop handle. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what my options are once i get the new one here to mess with. I have a bunch of extra buttons and a second hat that i could set up if i can find a place for them.<br /><br />I'm also looking into assigning a button to lock/hold the inputs. So if Im cruising or want to lift my hand, I can hit a button and the current inputs will be locked until i press it again. I know there's a related fork on github here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/jerdavis/DeltaThrottle">https://github.com/jerdavis/DeltaThrottle</a><!-- m --> , so i plan on looking at the code and adapting that. so, there's another button that i'll need to add!</div>
