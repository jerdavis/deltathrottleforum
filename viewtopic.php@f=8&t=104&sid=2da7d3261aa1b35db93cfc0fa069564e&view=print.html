				<div class="content">Well, at least my local public library has the objects in their queue for their 3D printer. I'm dying to see how this turns out.<br /><br />I hope to eventually re-print the handle with significant modifications after I figure everything out. Particularly I doubt it will be large enough or shaped correctly to comfortably hold the hats and buttons I want to put on it, and I also want to shape it to easily accept some Sugru (rubbery epoxy) so I can put pads shaped to my hand. I also want to put a slider on there, which would be a base modifier for the forward/reverse throttle. This is all theoretical dreaming but a man's got to have his dreams.<br /><br />I'm not sure if bigger Arduino would satisfy my desires or if I should use a pair of them to handle all of the axis and buttons. The only important limitation in my mind is that the three axis will ideally be on the same controller as my new slider to avoid having to use a virtual joystick drive to combine them. I won't care if the buttons show up as a dedicated controller.<br /><br />Thank you so much for releasing this online. It's given me reason to get into the 3D printing and reason to go further with Arduino than I have before.</div>
