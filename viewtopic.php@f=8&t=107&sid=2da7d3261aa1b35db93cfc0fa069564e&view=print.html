				<div class="content">I finally have all the parts but the cpu (got a wrong shipment from sparkfun and they are sending a new one), probably gonna build the main bits tomorrow and will post pics when I get it up!<br /><br />Here are the parts I have, starting assembly soon! working on cleaning the printed parts.<br /><br />Whole Set So far!<br /><img src="https://scontent-sea.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/11045358_10205735424881837_8772429178942633902_n.jpg?oh=24b17fe312b77edc926301e344da5ee8&amp;oe=55963CC1" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The printed parts<br /><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/11000285_10205735425521853_2917387668241094708_n.jpg?oh=3531c19d90513216724d434dc1f62ab0&amp;oe=558AD285&amp;__gda__=1434135776_6f4e1ecd077d93e76c3980a29180b8bd" alt="Image" /><br /><br />My cost so far was about $55 for 3d printing and $85 for parts (shipping is like $20 or 25 of that)<br /><br />How far are you guys with making the delta throttle?  as soon as I get the chip I should be good to go and should have it together in a few hours.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Jeremy</div>

				<div class="content">Finished cleaning the supports for the 3d printed parts with only 2 finger cuts! As you can see the armature fits right together!<br /><br />If you look I actually have a few extra as the printer I used was not sure of the strength of the t-glass material for what I was using it for.<br /><br /><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/10437618_10205748556250113_5592428171990101427_n.jpg?oh=09ce19fcce5c0bfbf1714c4e121396bd&amp;oe=557CD7E0&amp;__gda__=1434709125_aa100c9760bea59e7fc5100932d4a401" alt="Image" /></div>

				<div class="content">I used 3d hubs and fount Alton in Vancouver wa.  He had tglass and pla and abs and could do fine printing as well as being the second lowest bid in the portland area.<br /><br />Here are the instructions I sent him, I made a mistake on the small parts and he caught the number and corrected it for me as well, great service!<br /><br />-----------<br />DESCRIPTION <br />I am building a DeltaThrottle from <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.deltathrottle.com/">http://www.deltathrottle.com/</a><!-- m --><br />and the instructions and original stls are on github here <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/zdayton/DeltaThrottle">https://github.com/zdayton/DeltaThrottle</a><!-- m -->.<br /><br />The base_rev material doesn't matter but it does need to be flat and minimally warped so a heated print bed would be best here. Infill is recommended at 70% and layer height at 0.3mm.<br /><br />The Pivot arm side 1 and 2 pieces need to be T-Glass at 0.3mm with 70% infill.<br /><br />The Handle_2_bottom just needs to be oriented with the holes up so no supports are needed, printed at 0.3mm and 70% infill. PLA, ABS or T-Glass will work doesn't really matter.<br /><br />The Handle Top and Middle need to be fine and if you can do 0.1mm that would be great. Orient the Handle top as shown and the middle facing down so the supports are interior of the handle cavity.<br />Originally T-Glass not sure if it matters if its other material. 100% infill.<br /><br />The Pivot Arm Retainer and Spring clip need to be high detail since they are small so if you can do 0.1mm that would be great. Originally T-Glass not sure if it matters if its other material. 100% infill.<br /><br />The Pivot linkage need to be strong so this material needs to be PLA with 0.1mm and 100% infill.</div>
