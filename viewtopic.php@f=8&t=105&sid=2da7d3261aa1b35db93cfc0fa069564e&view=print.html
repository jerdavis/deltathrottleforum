				<div class="content">Glad to see I'm not the only one attempting this project.<br /><br />I just submitted the files to my university for printing (Gotta utilize the library before I graduate!) Should be ready in a week or sooner.<br /><br />Purchased parts:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">McMaster-Carr:</span>       Total came to <span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">$48.36</span> Plus &quot;applicable shipping charges&quot; (whatever that means)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Digi-Key:</span>               Only purchased the potentiometer. I can add switches later. Total come to about <span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">$15</span> (again shipping is not specified but an &quot;estimate&quot; was provided)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Sparkfun:</span>               Omitted the wire since not adding buttons now. Total: <span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">$28.99</span> (finally a solid answer on price lol)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Tower Hobbies:</span>      Total: <span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">$9.38</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">So for these parts I am spending about $110 after shipping. </span> (adding in about $9 for McMaster-Carr shipping.)<br /><br />Heads up to everyone: The pricing in the instructions is a bit off. <br />I am not too worried about this as I am more in it for the hobby but others may be shocked. <br />Simple math of the parts list he gives will show a difference too.<br /><br />Another note on parts. I didn't feel like doing too much research but it may be possible to get some parts locally. With my busy schedule i don't have that time but just a thought.<br /><br />I'll try to keep updating as parts arrive. Can't wait to start the build!</div>

				<div class="content">I can't wait to see what you build!  Thanks for the heads up that the pricing is off. There are a few different options for parts you could buy, I will take a look at the instructions again and update if need be. Although I will say I don't recall spending that much but I will double check.</div>

				<div class="content"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">All the parts are in! </span><br /><br />I should be getting photos up this weekend and am looking into doing a video of the build process.<br /><br />Final cost for the 3D printing came in at just under $15.<br /><br />Regarding the pricing, I chose to use the Hex Stand-offs instead of 3D printing the upper arms. <br />I personally liked the look of it. For those who print everything, it will be cheaper. <br />Also, again, I didn't bother to look around for price options. If anyone has cheaper solutions, please share with the community! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">So jealous of your printing costs! We don't have a service like that here, that I can find at least. In theory I can do it for free at the maker space I'm a member of but all the printers are down. Best I could find locally was around $300 to print the parts, about the same as Shapeways or some other online service.<br /><br />Good luck with your build, can't wait to see it!<br /><br />Regarding pricing, I picked up a pro micro board on ebay for around $6. I haven't tried programing it yet but it looks to be a generic version of the same series as the sparkfun pro micro. I'll report back on my thread when I've programmed and tested it. That was the biggest price break I was able to find looking for parts. I also ordered my traxxas parts from Amazon Prime. Not a big savings there.</div>

				<div class="content"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">It Broke!</span><br /><br />So I ran into a problem while shooting video number 3.<br />After getting the threaded inserts installed, I tried to assemble everything to check that it works.<br />When tightening the Spring Clips to the base, there were issues that arose and my attempt to get around it broke the base.   <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> <br /><br />Tomorrow spring break ends so timing is not bad. I will resubmit the design for re-printing but I am also making the fallowing revisions:<br /><br />This is the revised Base. I added a hole in the middle for the wires to go through.<br />Also changed the spring retaining method to be a solid wall with a hole. <br />You build the arm with the spring, slide the spring into the hole, then rotate the arm into position.<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/dZXIKBU.png?1" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />This is a base i created to place the Delta Throttle on, thus hiding the electronics<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jK7lS1z.png?1" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />New handle design. My hand din't find a good way to hold the current handle. <br />I am going to try this one. If it doesn't work, I can still use the original.<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/gbwJXzm.png?1" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xh3jy3M.png?1" alt="Image" /></div>
