				<div class="content">Oijando, please be very careful when assembling the new handle. The &quot;screw stadoffs&quot; as it were&quot; are very brittle. They're at an incorrect angle to the split of the handle, and trying to screw into them puts a lot of shear stress on them. Mine have snapped every time, and I end up using a soldering iron to melt them back into place.<br /><br />Ghostpilot, what's keeping you from using the revised on the github? I did get help creating a longer version of it. As far as adding more analog controllers, I think you're going to run into issues finding enough inputs on the Pro Micro board. Thoughts?</div>

Thoughts?</div></blockquote>My first thought is that I sometimes talk out of my ass before my brain have even begun to correct what I am about to say to fit the subject at hand... Of course the new handle is just that, a NEW handle.<br /><br />As someone was talking about earlier. Is there any good way to have toggle buttons for on/off functions? A software based solution would be easier, but there are hardware based ones too with latch switches. But switches like those will still need to be addressed in software in some way or another, I guess. Electronics isn't my strong side, neither is ergonomics. However, in my case I think my own inability to coordinate my own eye-hand movements will limit what inputs I can use comfortably, rather than the actual amount of inputs.<br /><br />Do you think there is any advantage to gain by having &quot;thumb-sticks&quot; for any other finger than the thumb?</div>

I'm trying to recreate SC-Maick's base to house the electronics, so perhaps I can edit the handle stl and reinforce/relocate the screw mounts as well.</div>
