Springs were not in stock and I have no feedback yet about ETA.<br /><br />Anyway, I will laser cut a base using plexiglass just to ensure everything fits correctly and then I will use 5mm anodized aluminum.<br /><br />Still looking for someone with cnc machinery to replace as many 3D printed parts as possible (spring retainers for example or even pivot arms).</div>

				<div class="content">Haven't open the file up yet.  Is the pivot arm and handle base in the drawing?  I have to install autocad on my gaming rig later today.<br /><br />The place that I visited can also do CNC work.  I can asked him how much it would cost to mill it.  I understand your in Greece and I am in NY, but it should give a good idea of the costs.  Could be a place to have the parts made for anyone in the US.<br /><br />Just in researching having the based cut is still cheaper than buying the raw 1/4 aluminum plate materials.</div>

				<div class="content">Looking forward to seeing your work SC-Maik and replicating here!!<br /><br />I've sent off the file to the metal fabricator and waiting on his quote.   When you get the design done for the arm can you post it?  I'll request for a quote here.<br /><br />Parts started to arrive here.  I'll test the Pro Micro boards when they arrive later today.<br /><br />Any designs on the Handle base?<br /><br />What did they charge for the pcb boards?  I haven't contacted the local company yet for pricing.  Was wondering what you used to design them?<br /><br />Awesome work SC-Maik!!! Awesome!!!</div>

				<div class="content">Typing on my phone...<br /><br />One freaking blackout killed my monitor... I am so upset atm!<br /><br />Anyway, PCB was designed using Sprint Layout 6. <br />Sample board was made in Greece, but for final board I've used <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.pcbway.com">www.pcbway.com</a><!-- w --> (China) <br /><br />I was about to start alternative design of arm but electricity had different plans for me...<br /><br />At least Actobotics parts are already in Greece and courier will deliver them to me first thing tomorrow.</div>

				<div class="content">This is awesome work, sorry I haven't been able to join in the conversation the last few days.  Something I want to point out, you may already know this but there are two possibilities for the poles on a cylindrical magnet.  The magnets I bought from digikey have poles like this:<br /><img src="http://i00.i.aliimg.com/img/pb/902/863/269/1286356279693_hz-myalibaba-web13_27146.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><br />This is important because if you put this magnet in the center of a shaft and rotate it, there is not any change of the magnetic field relative to the sensor.  I know because I made this exact mistake.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> One other important thing I learned is that the output of the sensor is affected by the rotation of the magnet as well as the position of the magnet relative to the sensor.  This becomes important if the sensor is not exactly lined up with the center of the shaft (It won't be) because the rotation of the magnet gets compounded with the change in position relative to the sensor, and the measurements get crappy.  What I found was that I got the cleanest measurements when I intentionally offset the magnet by a large amount, and lined up the poles so the rotation of the magnet would not affect the sensor, only the position of the magnet.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0Ic3mF8.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I also did a little concept redesign of the arms based on the design you have been working on.  I think a two piece arm that clamps over the shaft would be good.  I am worried about the set screw arrangement you have slipping, depending on the material you use for the arms.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/e2ge2ix.png" alt="Image" /></div>
