				<div class="content">Sticks have a lot of buttons. The T16000 has 12 on the base, 4 on the stick, plus an 8-way hat. To pick up a few more on this thing, consider the odds of needing to press more then one button at a time, let alone all of them. Set aside 4 inputs and plan for them to go to a decoder. Giving up 4 lines gets you 15 for a total of 21. Using a decoder you can only press 1 of those 15 at a time, but you still have 6 that can be pressed in any combo plus buttons on any other sticks.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello Vorg, very welcome to the Delta Throttle community.<br /><br />There are several tricks and solutions available to get multiple buttons working on an arduino-based joystick, ranging from the use of shift registers and I2C i/o expanders, to simply upgrading the electronics to something with more native i/o pins.<br /><br />I'm going to wire my delta throttle (once I get the basic mechanics figured out) to an Arduino Mega equivalent board, giving me access to 54 digital and 16 analog i/o pins.<br /><img src="https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/ArduinoMega.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />At that point, I'm already past what joy.cpl can handle for a single device, though there are ways to get more axes/buttons to work.<br /><br />I'm looking into putting together an alternative handle, possibly modeled to match the Warthog joystick. That should provide enough controls at your fingertips.<br />I'm thinking to put an analog ministick in place of the CMS switch or possibly the MMC.<br /><img src="http://www.simhq.com/_air13/images/air_462a_015.gif" alt="Image" /></div>

				<div class="content">I was thinking something more along the lines of a 74HC154 <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />As much as I would like to build one of these things, lack of funds will likely limit me to a second T.16000m with a really good sale and a month or two to pay it off. I already built an EdTracker a few months ago.</div>

				<div class="content">Quick and easy way could be utilizing two HID capable boards like a Teensy. It'll show as multiple devices, but as long as you keep the joystick axis's all on one board and just put buttons, hats, or even pots on others it should work fine.</div>
