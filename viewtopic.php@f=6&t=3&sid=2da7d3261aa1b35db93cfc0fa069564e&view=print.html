				<div class="content">In your survey (at the site) I stated that I would happy to pay up to 150 dollars for the Delta. However I would just like to say that in its current state it looks very flimsy (it could break at any moment). <br /><br />The strength and quality of the build would reflect how much I would pay. I recently spent 100 dollars on a mouse that after 3 months, now no longer works. Yes it is guaranteed, however I hope you get my meaning.<br /><br />PS. Kickstarter or Licensing. However you go about it, I hope you succeed.</div>

				<div class="content">It's actually not too flimsy the way it is now. 3D printed parts are stronger than most people think, but I totally understand your point.  The durability is definitely something I would be doing some in depth analysis in before selling a bunch of them.</div>

				<div class="content">I had the same concern as individual1 - and if I only had a my own 3D printer or access to one, so I could print a &quot;backup&quot; if needed <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> - but I am happy you will do some research and analysis on the subject because that throttle looks AMAZING.<br /><br />I really hope you will succeed either by Kickstarter or some other venture! I will gladly support it no matter.</div>

Total build, would likely be around 200 to 225.<br /><br />I do like how you would &quot;Buy a kit&quot; for 30-50 dollars. You mean you would spend LESS than the cost of the materials to build it yourself? How generous of you...</div>
