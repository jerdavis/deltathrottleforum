				<div class="content">As you can see I have everything put together, but It looks like a complete mess. wires everywhere buttons not attached to anything, and my controller board just floating out in space.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Ca9rvW3l.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />This is the most complicated electronics project I've ever done, and probably the most complicated 3D print I've every run on my humble Printrbot Simple metal, which I think It did quite well despite some warping, most visible at the handle seam.<br /><br />I soldered my wires directly to the board which is why I I gave all the wires so much slack. I didn't think I would be able to properly manipulate them if I had them all trimmed short. but everything appears to be working despite how  kludged together it is.<br /><br />I really loved your build design zdayton, those heat inserts work really fantastically, and your instructions were very clear. However I did have the same problem as M2RiverRat when trying to use the most recent version of ardiuno, but downgrading it worked for me as well.<br /><br />So if anybody could show me some pictures of a close up on there wiring, or give me a few tips and tricks I would really appreciate it.</div>

				<div class="content">My wiring is kind of a mess right now too. I'm fixing it in my design by creating a second base where the arduino will be mounted and the wiring run. You can see that in my photos here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/24411428@N06/sets/72157648953168623/">https://www.flickr.com/photos/24411428@ ... 953168623/</a><!-- m --> or in my build thread. SC-Maik says he's going to do something similar with his 3d printed throttle, you can check that out in his build thread. He also has some nice looking wiring in his thread going towards a separate breakout board mounted in the middle of his base.<br /><br />Another option you might try if you have your own 3d printer would be to download and print this enclosure <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:320421">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:320421</a><!-- m --> It looked like it would fit when I placed the 3d models together in Netfab, but that was without springs in place. If it does fit you could bolt that down to house your arduino. To do the cable hookups you could either solder on some header pins and use pin connectors to do the hookup, or you could keep your wires soldered to the board and route them out to each pot like you see in SC-Maik's build thread. I like his method of measurement, routing the cables through the solder points on each Pot, it looks clean. You could mark the cable at that point and cut and strip it for soldering.<br /><br />Other than the wiring your build looks great! Love the color too. Good luck!</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the advice , I like the housing idea with header pins, that would also make it easier to add, or modify button placement more easily, to be honest soldering them directly onto my board was purely a result of me being exited to get the throttle working at all.</div>

				<div class="content">I just stuck my board down with some double stick tape, it is still hanging on strong so good enough for me <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.  I think seeing everyone else's builds has been my favorite part of this project. Seeing what modifications everyone is making and all of that is really cool.  I'm glad this was a good 3d print project for you as well, in general its good to see people printing things other than nick nacks and upgrades for their printer.</div>

				<div class="content">This might be slightly off topic but since you said that downgrading the IDE worked for you could you tell me how you got the ProMicro to show up in the boards list? For the life of me I can't get it to show up in 1.0.6 I think i followed all the variations of the online instructions and none of them worked for it. I can talk to the board in 1.6.7 though but everyone says that won't work.</div>
