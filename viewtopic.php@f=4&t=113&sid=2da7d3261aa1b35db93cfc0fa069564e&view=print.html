				<div class="content">So, assuming I was a total idiot and needed you to explain the entire process, start to finish, including how to go about using the files, if I were to find a makerbot replicator 2 at a local library, is there something that supports it?<br /><br />I mean, including a breakdown of a parts list at RadioShack, for example, and if all the parts can be found there, including a projected cost.<br /><br /><br />As an aside, do the parts (the 3D printed ones, at least) lend themselves to a more easily reproducible mold-and-cast sort of setup? And is the T-handle ready to go yet, or is it still in the planning phase?<br /><br />I'm assuming this thing lends itself very well to Star Citizen. Especially since now they allow for analog inputs for the maneuvering thrusters. I'm using an X-55 now, and while it's great for SOME stuff, moving around in a 6DOF setup is not. The Delta Throttle, an accompanying joystick, and a TIR seem like the way to go, though.</div>

				<div class="content">You're going to have a hard time sourcing the parts at Radio Shack, and even for the parts you might be able to find there you'll likely pay a premium. If you haven't yet, take a look at the build instructions PDF in the GitHub project. Towards the top of the instructions he's included a handy bill of materials that lists sources for the parts along with the part numbers. Be aware that the cost information in there is a little out of date and doesn't account for shipping.<br /><br />For a 3d printed throttle you'll need everything from the BOM. I opted for the cheaper music wire springs for my build and they're totally fine. I sourced my traxxas ball joints on Amazon as I have a prime membership so they were cheaper than ordering from the hobby shop. I also saved a fair chunk of change by getting my Pro Micro on Ebay (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;ghostText=&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_nkw=pro+micro+arduino&amp;rt=nc&amp;LH_PrefLoc=1">http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R4 ... _PrefLoc=1</a><!-- m -->).<br /><br />As far as assembly instructions, the PDF is also a good place to start. Most of the steps are covered quite well. In addition Sotnax is producing videos of his build process, check them out in his thread <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://deltathrottle.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=105">viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=105</a><!-- l -->.</div>
