				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>zdayton wrote:</cite>There probably won't be another 3d printed design. I am in the process of doing an injection molding design, but that is not DIY friendly.  For the 3d printed version, the pot actually has a much better bearing surface than you could get 3d printing, so it is kind of necessary.  I know it is a bad design in the traditional sense, but it makes sense to rely on the nice machined bearing surface of the pot over a bumpy 3d printed bearing.  I have used mine quite extensively and not seen any issues. Hopefully that answers your question.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I forgot to ask.  Is the plan to make the molded design available as a kit?</div>
