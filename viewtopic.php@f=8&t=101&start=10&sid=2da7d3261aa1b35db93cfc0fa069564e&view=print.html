				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Ghostpilot wrote:</cite>Longtime unregistered forum lurker from Sweden here. Yes, another European reporting in.<br />I finally decided to take the plunge and make my own delta throttle.<br />I work as CNC machinist and I have access to a CNC mill at work and I am planning to make most of the fabricated parts from aluminium by myself.<br />As most of the fabricated parts for a delta throttle are kind of small, it shouldn't be a problem to find scrap aluminium to make most if not all of the fabricated parts.<br /><br />Looking over some of the other mechanical parts needed, I noticed that some parts only sell in packs of ten or more when 1, 3 or 6 would be enough for one build.<br />Hoping that some of you have parts left over from your own builds, I am willing to work for parts.<br />(You send me parts and I pay for shipping while I send you parts in return where you pay for the shipping.)<br /><br />What I have to offer in a trade:<br />* Machine-time (which means I can make aluminium parts for your Delta Throttle build)<br />* I can engrave your logo, name or some cool text on your parts to make them truly yours.<br />* Metric screws and nuts are easy to come by in Europe. (All parts I make will have metric threads so you might want to trade for some while you're at it)<br />* Hexagonal nylon female-female and male-female rod extenders with M3 threads (I bought a big pack of them and I only need six of them)<br />* Metric hexagonal male-male stainless standoff, M3 threads (I can get M4 threaded also, but I think M3 will hold just fine)<br /><br />What I am looking for in a trade:<br />* Springs, both the three torsion springs and the Z homing spring<br />* PCB for hall effect sensors (I ordered free samples of 6800)<br />* Pro Micro (I haven't ordered one yet, so I might as well trade for one if I can)<br />* Aluminium rod ends with swivel ball insert (my plastic ones were free samples from igus.de. It would be nicer to have a more high end version)<br /><br />Are there any blueprints or plans that have <span style="font-weight: bold">all</span> measures listed. If I open STEP files or STL files in my CAD program the accuracy of the dimensions isn't that good for some reason.<br /><br />Just to clarify, I am not trying to sell kits or anything like that. Just trade parts for parts.<br />I don't want to bite the hand that feeds by making money from someone elseÂ´s idea, especially not when he wrote that he might make a kickstarter out of it at some point in the future.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />Another fellow Swede here.<br /><br />I found usable springs available at fjadrar.se (Sodemann Denmark) in low numbers and at a reasonable price. I'll get you the exact product numbers tomorrow.<br /><br />For the rest,  I bit the bullet and ordered from overseas (digi key, servocity), including closed hall sensor assemblies, so can't help you there.<br /><br />I'd be interested in cnc milled parts of you should need anything I can provide. I have an FDM 3d printer if printed PLA parts is something you lack.<br /><br />Where in Sweden are you located?</div>

				<div class="content">Good find on the spring supplier. They had just the ones needed after a little searching through the lists.<br />I'm in the early stages of the build, gathering items and raw materials, so I haven't actually made anything yet. The free samples from AMS arrived at my door at record speed.<br />The sales contact person for Igus.de in Sweden called me personally to arrange with the free samples of their plastic rod ends I ordered. Those are M3 threaded instead of M4, but they will hold.<br /><br />Edit: I just ordered the springs from fjadrar.se. It was a little on the expensive side I thought, but they had the springs needed for the build, so I won't have to order them from overseas.<br />For anyone in Europe, who want to order the same springs. Here are the part numbers (with links leading to the english version of the product page):<br />Torision springs: <a href="http://www.industrial-springs.com/online-shop/search?pid=T072-120-500L" class="postlink">T072-120-500L</a><br />Z home position spring: <a href="http://www.industrial-springs.com/online-shop/search?pid=E05000372250S" class="postlink">E05000372250S</a></div>
