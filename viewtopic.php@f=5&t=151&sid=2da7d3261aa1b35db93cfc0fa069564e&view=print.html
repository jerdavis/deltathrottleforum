				<div class="content">Recently there has been numerous junk posts by spam bots. Those posts are still there cluttering up the forum for us two or three people who still use this forum.<br />So are these forums to be considered abandoned from now on, or will a moderator step up and clean away those posts and restore order?<br />This post may have an irritated tone, but it is general irritation, I assure you. So don't take it personally, anyone who may read this.<br />Except if you are a spam bot. If so, I hate you.</div>

				<div class="content">I don't know. It was a burst of spam bot activity there, but it has been quiet for a while now.<br />It's doesn't matter who is moderator or who is not, as long as that someone checks in here from time to time to check that all is well.<br /><br />PS. I am sorry if my first post in this thread was fuled by anger, but that was the case then and there. Not intended to blame anyone in particular. Spam bots does what spam bots do I suppose.</div>

				<div class="content">More spam bot activity recently.<br />Why not make the two or three most active members administrators or co-administrators.<br />That way we could clean away the trash faster than if you alone should do it.</div>

				<div class="content">Maybe we should lift this discussion out of this thread into a new one. The topic of this thread isn't exactly what we are talking about now, is it?<br /><br />Since I am going to submit this answering post, I might as well fill it with something useful and give some input while I am at it.<br />I work as a CNC machinist, and I am mainly using a CNC mill at work. I can only give a very biased view from the world of CNC milling.<br />Even though it certainly IS possible to make a 100% &quot;millable&quot; version of the Delta Throttle, It would be best if cylindrical parts (such as the axles and upper arms) were turned in a lathe.<br />I myself will be milling the axles for my Delta Throttle, mostly because I have access to just a mill. In my daily job I don't handle price tags or need to bother with the market price for things I make, as 99% of all orders are internal within the company. So I am not very well suited to estimate a cost of CNC made versus another manufacturing methods.<br />However, I do know that most mechanical workshops that accept orders from individuals will do a calculation on a preliminary order if you send them proper material such as 3d models and/or plans or blueprints. Then you can ask them to estimate the cost of lets say 10 or 20 full delta throttle kits. All parts doesn't need to be in the same material. Most workshops will have access to various types of materials and can even recommend what material to use based on what function the part will have in the final assembly.<br /><br />We order 3d printed parts for things we are building at work from time to time. There are several methods of 3D printing today, ranging from the hobbyists glue-gun on a plotter version, to hyper modern full colour printers. Recently I saw plastic parts printed in a SLS 3D printer that had carbon powder added into the mix which acted both as a colour and a reinforcing ingredient, making thin parts more durable and the outcome charcoal black. Other than handling occasional 3d printed parts, I do not know much about the costs involved in commercial 3d printing.<br /><br />My advice is to draw plans for a more crude and basic version of the Delta Throttle and ask for price quotes for 20 complete sets from various mechanical workshops.<br />You will see that the price can vary quite much for the same parts from different manufacturers.</div>
