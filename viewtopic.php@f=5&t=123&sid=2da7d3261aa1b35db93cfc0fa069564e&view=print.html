				<div class="content">New here, saw the new handle design and wondered what buttons, switches, HATs you were thinking of making available?<br /><br />You have already removed the need for multiple analogue sticks just with this throttle!<br /><br />Looking at SC though, a small analogue stick for gimbal aiming would be a nice addition - <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9032">https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9032</a><!-- m --><br />Is a nice example of what would be available. The price is reasonable too though I am not sure what prices you will be able to get when buying bulk!<br /><br />I can also see a 4-way dpad or arrangement of buttons (spacing would make this a pain - the joys of not ever having to deal with ergonomics in my designs!) for moving around power with modifier buttons being useful as well.<br /><br />Of course, that being said, everything has a cost attached to it. Both a parts cost and a time cost!<br /><br />Just wanted to make a few suggestions for what is looking to be a very interesting project! (May build one if it doesn't cost the earth for shipping to South Africa for the parts I can't source locally)</div>

				<div class="content">I added a PSP thumb stick to mine(<!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.adafruit.com">www.adafruit.com</a><!-- w --> has them).  The Pro Micro has 4 labelled analog to digital inputs and 5 unlabelled ones.  I'm still getting used to it &amp; making tweaks, so I haven't been able to fully utilize the thumb stick just yet.</div>
