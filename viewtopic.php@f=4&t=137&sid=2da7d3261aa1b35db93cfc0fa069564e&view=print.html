				<div class="content">First up, a big thanks to everyone who has contributed to this project. Your insights have enabled me, someone who is not an engineer by any means, to complete my very own delta throttle. After obtaining all the components I was able to assemble it and get the delta throttle up and running in the better part of a day. I didn't say I didn't have my own issues. <br /><br />I have known about the delta throttle for a while, I loved the concept, but the lack of buttons put me off of taking on the project myself. One day I stumbled upon a post on the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/2oi4gc/semifinished_currently_held_together_with_duct/" class="postlink">SC Reddit</a> where a guy had taken the CH Pro Throttle handle and mated it to a Thrustmaster T-16000M. The stick handled strafing in SC, forward, back, left right and the throttle handle provided controls. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/dvrevWt.jpg" class="postlink">Here is the picture.</a> <br /><br />After seeing that, it got the ball rolling. After I completed the assembly of my own delta throttle and verified everything worked I contacted Whitesnake on the RSI Forums who did the original mod for some assistance. He gave me some pointers on what on what to expect with disassembly of the CH Pro Throttle and gave me a link I had missed on <a href="http://www.simhq.com/_technology2/technology_076a.html" class="postlink">SImHQ of the Frankenpotato</a>. The best part is - for this CH/Delta hybrid you don't have to cut any wires and if you change your mind you are able to reassemble your CH Throttle, no harm, no foul. But no warranty <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br />Further plans are to add a spring like SC-Maik to assist with centering. And maybe a reset switch. I am still thinking about what will be useful going forward. Still a lot to learn.<br /><br />Thanks again everyone!<br /><br /> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/lyk7qKQ.jpg?1" alt="Image" /></div>
