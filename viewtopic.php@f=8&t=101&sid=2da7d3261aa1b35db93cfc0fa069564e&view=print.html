				<div class="content">I tried to order from mcmaster but they cancelled my order<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Thank you for considering McMaster-Carr for your purchase, but we have cancelled your order for music wire, studs, screws, standoffs, and inserts.<br /> <br />Due to the cost of complying with extensive US export regulations, McMaster-Carr accepts international purchases only from our established international customers.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Looking around hardware stores in my town I couldn't find one with that level of DIYness. But even if I found one, it seems that it's impossible to find the same torsion springs anywhere, the different ways of naming the parts of the spring and measurement systems are driving me insane @_@</div>

				<div class="content">Just bought my parts, in the US, sorry. While shopping however I noticed that if you look up the parts for McMaster-Carr, they give you VERY detailed descriptions. <br /><br />You might be able to give those descriptions to someone locally and see if they can help.<br /><br />Another option would be to use those descriptions in searching online for alternate retailers.<br /><br />Hope this helps!</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks.  I will have a thorough search.  So far the budget killer is shipping due to all the different suppliers I'll have to use  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> <br />I'll work something out though I'm sure.</div>

				<div class="content">Would anyone with spares be kind enough to sell some to me?<br />I'm mainly struggling to find the springs but I'll certainly buy some of the machine screws and threaded inserts if you have them spare.</div>

				<div class="content">Longtime unregistered forum lurker from Sweden here. Yes, another European reporting in.<br />I finally decided to take the plunge and make my own delta throttle.<br />I work as CNC machinist and I have access to a CNC mill at work and I am planning to make most of the fabricated parts from aluminium by myself.<br />As most of the fabricated parts for a delta throttle are kind of small, it shouldn't be a problem to find scrap aluminium to make most if not all of the fabricated parts.<br /><br />Looking over some of the other mechanical parts needed, I noticed that some parts only sell in packs of ten or more when 1, 3 or 6 would be enough for one build.<br />Hoping that some of you have parts left over from your own builds, I am willing to work for parts.<br />(You send me parts and I pay for shipping while I send you parts in return where you pay for the shipping.)<br /><br />What I have to offer in a trade:<br />* Machine-time (which means I can make aluminium parts for your Delta Throttle build)<br />* I can engrave your logo, name or some cool text on your parts to make them truly yours.<br />* Metric screws and nuts are easy to come by in Europe. (All parts I make will have metric threads so you might want to trade for some while you're at it)<br />* Hexagonal nylon female-female and male-female rod extenders with M3 threads (I bought a big pack of them and I only need six of them)<br />* Metric hexagonal male-male stainless standoff, M3 threads (I can get M4 threaded also, but I think M3 will hold just fine)<br /><br />What I am looking for in a trade:<br />* Springs, both the three torsion springs and the Z homing spring<br />* PCB for hall effect sensors (I ordered free samples of 6800)<br />* Pro Micro (I haven't ordered one yet, so I might as well trade for one if I can)<br />* Aluminium rod ends with swivel ball insert (my plastic ones were free samples from igus.de. It would be nicer to have a more high end version)<br /><br />Are there any blueprints or plans that have <span style="font-weight: bold">all</span> measures listed. If I open STEP files or STL files in my CAD program the accuracy of the dimensions isn't that good for some reason.<br /><br />Just to clarify, I am not trying to sell kits or anything like that. Just trade parts for parts.<br />I don't want to bite the hand that feeds by making money from someone else´s idea, especially not when he wrote that he might make a kickstarter out of it at some point in the future.</div>
