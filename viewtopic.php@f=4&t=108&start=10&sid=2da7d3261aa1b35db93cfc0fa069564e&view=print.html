				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>mrjester wrote:</cite>What about a design for right-hand use?</div></blockquote><br /><br />The same handle design mirrored will work.  I don't think I will be molding a right handed version, the costs is too high, but if a lefty wants to buy one i will probably offer a 3d printed mirrored handle.<br /><br />In other news I printed the handle posted above.  As many of you guessed it is too small, especially for me as I have big hands.  Something else I learned is that a large angle from horizontal is bad.  It looked good on paper but did not feel good.  So I ended up scrapping this design, the lesson learned here is to get the basic shape you want before doing all the work of designing for molding.  Here is a comparison shot of the original and the first revision.<br /><br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Bb2G5Gr.jpg" class="postlink">http://i.imgur.com/Bb2G5Gr.jpg</a><br /><br />So there are a couple tough considerations here, first is that a bigger handle feels better in your hand, but is worse in a lot of other aspects.  First of all a big handle looks bad.  Unfortunately its not like a joystick where the size of the entire device is dictated by the handle.  The size is mostly dictated by the arms, and the handle needs to have a similar size or it will look weird.  Second, a big handle is bad for fine control.  It seems like the point on my hand where I have the best control is right beneath my third knuckle on my index finger, just at the top of my palm.  So for my handle I want that spot as close to the center of the plate where all the arms meet up.  If the handle is too tall, you put lots of moment on the handle and that makes the whole thing harder to control, same with if the handle is too far off to one side.  So in general I want the handle to be as small as possible while still being comfortable, and try to get the point on my hand where I feel like i have most control right in the center of the device.  <br /><br />What I ended up doing was a curved handle.  This is good because it fills up more of your palm, but visually still appears small and fits in with the rest of the device.  The current version is a little too tall, and needs the post moved a bit forward, but so far I like the feel.<br /><br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/gE2EXel.jpg" class="postlink">http://i.imgur.com/gE2EXel.jpg</a><br /><br />Hand position while holding the handle.<br /><br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/oUOvqug.jpg" class="postlink">http://i.imgur.com/oUOvqug.jpg</a></div>

				<div class="content">I printed a prototype of my new handle design and I think it is going to be the final design.  Maybe some minor tweaks but I really like it.  Here is the mostly complete CAD.<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VRq8jXD.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />And here is a quick video of the buttons.  There are a few minor issues.  The buttons are not quite tall enough, and some other stuff like that, but I really like this design.<br /><br /><a href="https://youtu.be/28_0lJHtExk" class="postlink">https://youtu.be/28_0lJHtExk</a></div>

				<div class="content">The new prototype looks great! What do you have the buttons mounted on internally? Are those standoffs for threaded inserts on the underside of the button bezel to mount a board of some sort?<br /><br />Thanks for the update. I can't wait to get a new handle printed for testing, even if the design is not optimized for 3d printing.</div>

				<div class="content">Have you decided to go with this? I mean, I'd like to use this one and think I would prefer it over the standard. I'm looking at firing off a print soon, so if you could post the alternate handle .stl files soon, I'd appreciate it.</div>

				<div class="content">I just got an email that the new handle is printed and ready to pick up! ZDayton, did you use different buttons and hat than in the original spec? What options are there for a cap for the hat?<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic">Edit:</span> Nevermind, answered my own question. Hat is the same, but buttons are different. Still looking for a suitable cap that fits both the hat shaft and the hole in the handle. Suggestions?<br /><br />New buttons: <a href="http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en?x=4&amp;y=17&amp;lang=en&amp;site=us&amp;keywords=CKN10388CT-ND" class="postlink">http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en?x=4&amp;y=17&amp;lang=en&amp;site=us&amp;keywords=CKN10388CT-ND</a><br />Hat: <a href="http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en?KeyWords=EG4561-ND&amp;WT.z_header=search_go" class="postlink">http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en?KeyWords=EG4561-ND&amp;WT.z_header=search_go</a><br />Connector: <a href="http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en?x=26&amp;y=15&amp;lang=en&amp;site=us&amp;keywords=455-1572-1-ND" class="postlink">http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en?x=26&amp;y=15&amp;lang=en&amp;site=us&amp;keywords=455-1572-1-ND</a></div>
