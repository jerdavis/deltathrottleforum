				<div class="content">Personally I wouldn't use too much money for the printed parts. You could try to find a cheaper access to a printer through a friend who owns one or something like that.<br /><br />People here are still improving the original build, so you could get a bit disappointed by paying loads of money to build the original throttle and then notice how much better it could have been. I finished the original build with the new handle design myself a few days ago, but I'm already planning to build an improved version at some point. SC-Maik's build is a great example of the improvements with Hall-sensors and the spring to hold it at Z-axis zero position without the weight of the hand to push it down.<br /><br />So, if I didn't have my own printer to make the parts, I probably would have waited at least until there is some kind of &quot;final version&quot;, with most of the improvements implemented.</div>

				<div class="content">Many thanks for the parts list it will be a huge help, now I have to go over it a see what's what and if any of the parts I have will work. I'm sure I'll have questions in couple of hours.<br /><br /><br />Pingku  You make an excellent point but I want one NOW,  hehe Really tho I have to build two anyways , my wife is wanting one as well, and in the process of figuring  out how this will work in game I realized how silly a omni directional throttle in a space ship is. Now it really bugs me when I play.<br />Prob take me better than a month to get one done, the soft wear is probably going to make my wife insane, she's the programmer in the family. <br /><br />Any way thanks again for the help guys.</div>

				<div class="content">Well after reading all that stuff on fabricating  hall sensors, I think it's beyond my skill set. But I'm pretty sure I can install a pot or 3. And since I have the analog pots and the 3.5v board from spark fun I'm going that route. Gonna set down and check all the size specks but I sofar don't can't see any reason why not. The hall sensors I'm sure are more accurate and smoother, when I build my wife's I'll prob use the hall pots there.<br />At least that's the plan for now. Thank you very much for the help.</div>

				<div class="content">The boards SC-Maik designed and shared that I had fabbed by OSH Park showed up yesterday. I haven't had a change to get them out and look at them or use them yet, but once I verify they're working I'll share the project on OSH Park if SC-Maik is cool with that. 3 boards cost $5.05 from them. I ordered 6 in case I mess up a few <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.</div>

Feel free to share project. I hope everything works fine for you as it did for me.<br /><br />My suggestion is to NOT use PGO mode. Use sensors out of the box without programming. <br />One 100nF Capacitor for C1, one 10Î¼F for C2 and one 0Ohm resistor (or just solder a wire) for R3.<br /><br />Let me know if you need more info.</div>
