				<div class="content">What about medical tubing , don't  remember what it's called but it was used for the wrist rocket. It's hollow so you could put a nut inside for an adjustment screw up through the bottom. It's early and I'm only part way through my coffee so I could be way off base here, but makes sense atm.<br /><br />I'll be starting my first build in a week or so, starting with the printed version. But your build seem the most promising for a finished throttle. And my wife has made it clear she wants one as well. So keep going the the way you are cause it looks great.</div>

				<div class="content">First off all, welcome!<br /><br />It makes perfect sense and I have already tried medical tubes, the ones others using for slingshots, but it was too stiff.<br /><br />Best bet is extension spring which will have 2.5&quot; height (minimum height when throttle is fully pressed downwards) and by choosing different wire size and/ or width I will find the correct spring.<br />Once I find that, I will post my ideas on how it could be adjusted.<br /><br />Tell your wife to wait. This is my second built but still experimenting with it. Getting ready for 3rd final one (hopefully). And I haven't even started modding the handle !!!<br /><br />Anyway, below some ingame footage<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDyn2EdkrYE" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDyn2EdkrYE</a><br /><br />I am using only delta throttle and nothing else.</div>

I'm kinda out of my comfort zone this kinda of thing, love following along tho always manage to learn something new. <br /><br />I have been working on a flight/gaming chair working mostly on comfort and posture to eliminate  any rsi in the elbows and wrist that effect  so many gamers.

If you can notice when I put my hand on throttle it lowers for about 0.25&quot;. <br />Deadzone compensates just that. Hopefully spring will solve this problem.<br /><br />Pivots rotate smoothly with no resistance at all.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Cybertraxs wrote:</cite>Not sure if you saw this, if not then check out the specs on these springs from McMaster:  <a href="http://www.mcmaster.com/mv1431722803//#extension-springs/=xc9ofe" class="postlink">http://www.mcmaster.com/mv1431722803//#extension-springs/=xc9ofe</a><br /><br />I've already ordered 3 inch springs... looks like I'll have to order the 2 1/2 inch... <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />I'll start a new thread on my build.<br /><br />Great work Michalis!!!!</div></blockquote><br /><br />I can't use McMaster's site... they won't even let me log in. Their excuse was that I am located in Europe and they don't ship here. Go figure.<br />I have ordered from a local spring manufacturer 0.5&quot; width x 0.37&quot; wire x <span style="font-weight: bold">40&quot;</span> !!! for my tests. Of course I want a find a ready spring that is globally available for everyone and avoid custom solutions, but I have to start somewhere.<br /><br />Let me know if you need 3D part designs for your build. I owe you a .step file of my base but I have to add extra wholes for the spring.<br /><br />Off to work now.</div>
