				<div class="content">HempStick is something I came across whist looking into building custom controllers. For better / more info on that <a href="http://www.hempstick.org/" class="postlink">http://www.hempstick.org/</a><br /><br />From what I have read going through his documentation on that site, hempstick is basically way to run joysticks, buttons, switches, etc. on a more robust board than the one that is being used here for this project.<br /><br />I am certainly not a programmer by any means but can somewhat read / understand what the code here is doing. I am interested in building this throttle using a bigger board like one of the two HempStick is built on to have access to more buttons and hat switches and such. Now if the DeltaThrottle was done with simple x,y,z axis (axes?) &gt;.&gt;  this wouldn't be much of a problem, just figure out where to wire the pots on the other board and away we go, but looking at the code here it looks like there are quite a few different math equations used before the input from the pots is output to the PC. <br /><br />What I was wondering is if anyone has any experience with HempStick and or where in the HempStick code the math translations might go to make this work? Would it be copy/paste like or is it something that would really have to rewrite a bunch of the HempStick code to make it go?<br /><br />Any ideas much appreciated and serious kudos to Mr. Dayton for creating this... really looking forward to starting the journey into building one of these <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

Then once that is edited - you have a delta on HempStick.</div>

				<div class="content">Nice <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> so this IS possible and thanks for taking a look <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />As stated am mostly novice, but I was thinking along those lines myself upon further investigation in the HempStick code.<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />-Zeroing the axes would go in the Init section?<br />-Would handle translating the x,y,z axes outside that main for() loop in the adc task and then start the loop from 3 (if x,y,z is adc channels 0,1,2) ?<br /><br />hmm... well i suppose now i REALLY need to go find and learn myself how to 3d design and print stuff to make this &gt;.&gt;</div>
