				<div class="content">It feels like I am banning spam bots and deleting huge piles of spam post every other day recently.<br />Is there anything that can be done to prevent them from spamming the forum in the first place?<br />There was one day that the forum was filled with loads of not safe for work spam posts. I had no idea and just clicked on one to do the &quot;ban user/delete post&quot;-chore as usual. That was an embarrassing surprise.</div>

				<div class="content">It's likely that the forum software needs updating. Might also need to install some different spam detection on the registration page. Could consider making user accounts require admin permission as well but that puts a big barrier on legitimate users getting involved.<br /><br />I haven't been active, but I do load the page every few days to see if there are new posts. If I can get some moderation or admin access  I can try to help out a bit.</div>

				<div class="content">I am fed up with deleting not safe for work spam bot posts in the forum. It's too much to handle now. 20 or 30 I could clean away. But now when they attack in the hundreds I can't do it anymore.<br />Perhaps it's time to let the forum die now.</div>
